This  research  project  aims  at  studying  heart  ratelevels  by  identifying  stages  of  stress  across  differenttime  intervals  in  patients  wearing  heart  rate  sensormonitors.   In  doing  so,  our  goal  is  to  re-implementprevious scientific work conducted by Lin et al., 2019on the paperMedical Time Series Classification withHierarhical  Attention-Based  Temporal  ConvolutionalNetworks:  a  Case  Study  of  Myotonic  Dystrophy  Di-agnosis[1].  While this invention focuses on the inter-pretable diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy from analy-sis of handgrip time series data, we propose that thismodel can also be used for time-series data for measur-ing stress levels.  Therefore,  we present an HA-TCNmodel capable of classifying levels of stress based onheart rate monitoring at different time-steps, furtherdemonstrating  that  this  model  has  applicability  be-yond its current use.In this project,  we take on the challenge of devel-oping a temporal convolutional neural network capa-ble of determining stages of increase heart rate levelswith  an  addition  of  an  attention  model  that furtherprovides the benefit of identifying relevant behavior indifferent time-steps while decreasing noise in the dataand adjusting importance of relevant patterns for thebinary  classification  of  stress  levels.   We  show  thatour model is capable of learning at a fast rate whilealso providing an accuracy score beyond 90%, lettingus infer that this model is another milestone for theinclusion of artificial intelligent models in the healthcare field
